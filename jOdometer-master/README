jOdometer is a counter that works like an odometer: moving the numbers up like in a wheel. It supports decimals.

We can configure:

* Start number
* Stop number
* Delay between the number change
* Increment units
* Speed and easing of the animation
* Easing of the animation
* Different styling options, including a PSD to edit the numbers image.
* Whether to format large numbers with comma or not.

We can also update the numbers manually/dynamically.
